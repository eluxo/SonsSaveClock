### What does this mod do?

I heard the rumor that there are people around that tend to forget the time
in Sons of the Forest and so also forget to regularly save the game.

As you can quickly end up in situations that are pretty bad, not having a
recent save game can set you back by hours. This mod will show you the time
since you have saved for the last time on the screen, so that you hopefully
don't ever forget about it again.

It does not autosave or anything else. It would be easy to implement some
autosave mod, as there are functions available for this, but it drastically
changes the game experience. So this will not be included.

### Forking the mod

I will only maintain this mod as long as I use it for myself. But feel free to
fork and do your own development.

Please honor the license: This is GPLv2.1. Whenever you copy the code and
create your own code based on it, release your changes. OpenSource mods are the
driving force of the modding community. Doing closed source stuff, destroys the
spirit of the community. Stealing code ignoring the licenses, is even worse.

Be fair, as the more open the community is, the better mods will be
