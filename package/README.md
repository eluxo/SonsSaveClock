### What does the mod do?

Simple: It adds a clock on the top of the screen that dates back to your last
save game.

Why? Because I always forget to save in games that don't have autosave and
when I am live on twitch, it even get's worse. And as I am hosting a world,
not saving in time can be bad for the whole team.

So this always shows me how much time has passed since my last save.

### Configuration

There is a configuration file in BepInEx\Config\net.eluxo.SonsSaveClock.cfg
that should allow you to change the panel in size and location.

### Code

Game modding heavily depends on code being public. A good modding community
can only grow, if knowledge is freely exchanged, so here is the code:

- [github](https://github.com/eluxo/SonsSaveClock)

I will only maintain the mod as long as I use it, but it is very simple.
Feel free to fork and/or experiment, as long as you keep your changes open
(it's GPLv2.1).
